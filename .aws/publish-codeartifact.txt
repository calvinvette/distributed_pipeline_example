This is the clean way is a GitHub Actions publish job that:
	* Assumes an AWS IAM role via GitHub OIDC (no long-lived AWS keys), - see github-oidc.txt
	* Fetches a CodeArtifact auth token + PyPI repository endpoint,
	* Builds with uv build, then uploads with uv publish.

AWS explicitly documents using aws codeartifact get-authorization-token + get-repository-endpoint for Python publishing flows.  ￼

uv supports 'uv build' + 'uv publish' and can publish to a custom publish URL with username/password.
