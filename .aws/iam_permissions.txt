To mint the token, AWS requires both codeartifact:GetAuthorizationToken and sts:GetServiceBearerToken.  ￼

To publish, CodeArtifact requires codeartifact:PublishPackageVersion (and in some formats/flows PutPackageMetadata is also relevant).  ￼

(You’ll usually want to replace * with the specific domain/repo/package ARNs once you confirm the exact domain/repo names.))
