The assumed role needs, at minimum:
	•	codeartifact:GetAuthorizationToken
	•	codeartifact:GetRepositoryEndpoint
	•	codeartifact:PublishPackageVersion (and related publish actions; exact set varies by org policy)
	•	sts:GetServiceBearerToken (commonly required by CodeArtifact auth flows)
	•	Trust policy allowing GitHub OIDC for your org/repo

Most orgs already have a “standard CodeArtifact publisher role” pattern; this job plugs into that cleanly.
